# The-Story-App
A story panel extraction tool that converts sketchbook thumbnails into pitch-able story panels.
The Story App works best with pre-formatted thumbnail frames.  
1. LOAD IMAGE: Upload image with multiple thumbnails. 7000px will work for most 9 panel grids. Add 200px per panel across.
2. ADJUST IMAGE: Use the Adjust Image tool to sweeten the image for best readability.
3. DETACT PANELS: Use the Detect panel toll to select panels that you want to export.
  A. The order that you select the thumbnails will dictate their sequence.
  B. Click CLOCKWISE on the corners of the thumbnail images you want to export.
  C. Choose the appropriate Resolution Setting.
    * 1080 (defalt/Pan) for single panels or multiple panels wide.
    * 1920 (default/crane) for single panels or multiple panels tall.
    * Custome to rely on original upload resolution.
4. CONVERT & EXPORT: Click on this button once our panels are selected.
   A. Rename prefix for files (optional) and browse to destination folder.
   B. Choose export setting to either overwrite panels of the same name/number or to continue numbering sequence.
5. CLEAR IMAGE: Use this button to start a new image upload.
6. Sort exported panels in Adobe Bridge or whatever app allows you to resort sequences.
